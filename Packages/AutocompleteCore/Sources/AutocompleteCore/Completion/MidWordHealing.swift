/// Token healing for a caret sitting *inside* a word the user is typing.
///
/// A base model continues a clean token boundary far better than one that ends mid-token. When the
/// prefix is `"The weather is gre"` the model is stuck in a subword state — the natural whole-word
/// token `" great"` is unreachable because `gre` has already been committed — so a cheaper subword
/// (`"asy"` → *greasy*) can outscore the right one (`"at"` → *great*). This is a *ranking* defect,
/// not a display one (see ADR-019).
///
/// The fix: back the prompt up to the last clean token boundary (`plan().head`) and constrain
/// regeneration to the removed bytes (`plan().heal`, e.g. `" gre"`) using the decoder's
/// `requiredPrefixBytes` machinery. The model then ranks `" great"` by its natural distribution.
/// The re-emitted stem is removed from what is shown/inserted via `strip(_:heal:)`.
