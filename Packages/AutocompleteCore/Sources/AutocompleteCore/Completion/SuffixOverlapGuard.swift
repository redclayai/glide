//  SuffixOverlapGuard.swift
//  AutocompleteCore
//
//  Detects mid-line / fill-in-the-middle completions that merely reproduce text the user already
//  has *after* the caret.
//
//  On a small model, FIM decoding (`<|fim_prefix|>…<|fim_suffix|>…<|fim_middle|>`) frequently
//  degenerates into copying the suffix back out as the "middle" — e.g. with the caret at
//  "…level of per|formance to the RTX 5070…" the model emits "formance to the RTX 5070, so it's",
//  which is exactly the text already to the right of the cursor. Showing (and inserting) that would
//  duplicate the user's own words. Per the product principle "prefer suppression to a wrong
//  suggestion", such candidates are dropped.
//
//  The comparison is on alphanumerics only (case-folded, punctuation/whitespace/garbage glyphs
//  removed) so a stray leading "**"/"•" the model sometimes prepends doesn't defeat the match.
