# KeyType Completion Benchmark

Offline evaluation harness for KeyType's final, user-visible completion behavior.

The runner evaluates the production-like path:

1. Resolve `AppCompatibilityStore` policy.
2. Apply mid-word healing.
3. Build the production prompt with `PromptBuilder` and the model tokenizer.
4. Decode through `ConstrainedGenerationEngine` with production app-compatibility policy.
5. Run `DefaultCandidateFilter`.
6. Strip healed stems and reconcile the caret boundary.
7. Score the final shown text or suppression reason.

`qualityScore` is a non-negative utility score: correct inserts and correct policy suppressions are
worth `1.0`, acceptable suppression on positive rows is worth `0.3`, and wrong visible suggestions
are worth `0.0`. Wrong suggestions are not hidden; use `wrongShowRate` and `precisionWhenShown` as
the UX guardrails before comparing utility and latency.

Latency numbers are only meaningful in release builds:

```sh
swift run -c release --package-path Packages/KeyTypeBench KeyTypeBench run --suite smoke
```

Useful commands:

```sh
# Validate the committed public smoke fixture without loading a model.
swift run --package-path Packages/KeyTypeBench KeyTypeBench validate --suite smoke

# Run smoke against the default KeyType model/profile, if installed.
swift run -c release --package-path Packages/KeyTypeBench KeyTypeBench run --suite smoke

# Profile opt-in mid-line/FIM behavior on edge rows.
swift run -c release --package-path Packages/KeyTypeBench KeyTypeBench run \
  --suite edge \
  --enable-mid-line

# Run one or more explicit models.
swift run -c release --package-path Packages/KeyTypeBench KeyTypeBench run \
  --suite core \
  --cases KeyTypeBench-20260603/Datasets/core.jsonl \
  --model "/path/to/model-a.gguf" \
  --model "/path/to/model-b.gguf"

# Compile human-written source documents into cases.
swift run --package-path Packages/KeyTypeBench KeyTypeBench compile \
  --sources KeyTypeBench-20260603/Private/source-docs.jsonl \
  --output KeyTypeBench-20260603/Private/core.jsonl \
  --suite core \
  --split eval
```

The committed `smoke` suite is tiny and public. Larger `core`, `edge`, `latency`, and
`human-calibration` datasets should live under `KeyTypeBench-20260603/Private/` or
`KeyTypeBench-20260603/Datasets/private/`, both of which are gitignored.

Outputs are written as:

- `rows.jsonl`: row-level diagnostics, including top candidates, prompt token count,
  suppression reason, score contribution, and latency.
- `aggregate.json`: aggregate metrics plus per-tag breakdowns.
- `aggregate.csv`: one row per model, suitable for plotting utility, wrong-show risk, precision,
  and latency.
