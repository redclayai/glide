# KeyType — Architecture

This describes the module graph, each module's responsibility, the runtime data flow, and the
existing code you build on. It is a *behavior-level* reconstruction (see clean-room rules in
`00-overview.md`).

## End-to-end pipeline

The pipeline is **latency-first**: each keystroke or focus change invalidates only part of the
state. Stable prompt prefixes stay warm in the KV cache; only the changed suffix plus candidate
generation costs compute.

## Module responsibilities & current state

All modules are local SwiftPM packages under `Packages/`. The shared contract lives in
**`AutocompleteCore`**; every other package depends on it.

### `AutocompleteCore` — the contract ✅
Domain types and protocols shared by all modules. Already defined:
- `TextFieldContext` (before/after cursor, `TextSelection`, `TextFieldGeometry` with `cursorRect`,
  `AppTarget`, placeholder, labels, language, typing context).
- `CompletionRequest` (context, prompt, `requiredPrefixBytes`, `CompletionMode`,
  `maxCompletionTokens` default **4**, `maxDisplayWidth`).
- `CompletionCandidate`, `CompletionMode` (`prose/code/terminal/emoji/correction`).
- `SuppressionReason` (the full filter taxonomy).
- Protocols: `ContextProviding`, `CompletionGenerating`, `CandidateFiltering`.
- `typealias TokenID = Int32`.

**Rule:** new cross-module types belong here. Keep it free of AppKit/llama dependencies.

### `MacContextCapture` — focus & text snapshot ✅
Notification-driven `AccessibilityContextTracker` (AX observers on focus/window/selection/value/
destroy/miniaturize, debounced, with a low-frequency safety poll) and a `FocusedFieldReader` that
populate a full `TextFieldContext`:
- before/after cursor text, selection, caret rect, end-of-line & RTL state.
- environment: bundle id, window title, URL/domain (`AXWebArea`/`AXURL`), field labels, detected
  language (`NLLanguageRecognizer`).
- never blocks the main thread; re-targets on app activation. See ADR-006.
The on-screen caret rectangle is resolved by `AXCaretGeometryResolver`, **ported from `Red Dot`**
(see below). Browser focus/caret edge cases are handled by ADR-027/028/029/033.

### `Prompting` — sectioned budgeted prompt ✅
See `02-prompting.md`. Implements `PromptSection`, priority/min/max budgets, truncation modes,
`PromptBuilder` (base-continuation + ChatML), a **tokenizer-backed** counter (via `ModelRuntime`,
ADR-008) with the approximate counter as a fallback, caret-boundary sanitization, policy-gated
native FIM, and per-app environment-context gating + personalization wiring (ADR-017/023/082).

### `ModelRuntime` — local LLM ✅
`LlamaModelRuntime` wraps **llama.cpp** (prebuilt xcframework, ADR-007): GGUF load,
tokenize/detokenize, raw token bytes, batch decode, next-token logits, EOS/EOT, vocab size.
`prepare` reuses the KV cache on a **pure append** (clear + full re-decode otherwise — partial
`seq_rm` rollback is unsafe on this model's hybrid recurrent memory). Branch scoring uses
`anchoredLogits(anchor:suffix:)`, which decodes the anchor once and reuses it via `llama_state_seq`
snapshot/restore (cross-sequence `llama_memory_seq_cp` **aborts** on the hybrid recurrent memory, so
it is not used; see ADR-018). `StubModelRuntime` + `UTF8FallbackTokenizer` are retained for tests;
keep the `LocalModelRuntime` protocol stable (the `anchoredLogits` default extension keeps stubs
unchanged).

### `ConstrainedGeneration` — the decoding loop ✅(multi-branch)
`ConstrainedGenerationEngine: CompletionGenerating` performs real constrained decoding (M5,
ADR-010): a deterministic best-first **multi-branch** search honouring `branchWidth`,
`relativeCutoff` (cumulative-logprob margin), and `minBranchProbability`; top-k/top-p/temperature
shaping with cumulative log-probability scoring (`TokenSampler`); required-prefix + byte/trie
admissibility from the profile (`tokenAllowed(_:afterRequiredPrefix:)`, advanced per branch);
incremental UTF-8-validated detokenization (`GenerationBranch` + `UTF8Scanner`); and stop on
EOS/EOT, `.stopAndSuppress`, sentence-end (`.stopAndDisplay`, disambiguated against context by
`SentenceBoundary` so `1.`/`Mr.`/`e.g.` don't truncate — ADR-013), display-width limit,
`maxCompletionTokens`, or an inadmissible transition. A `CurrentWordTypoGuard` drops a branch the
instant the user's current word *closes* into a misspelling (via the injected `WordRecognizing` /
`NSSpellChecker`), inside the beam so the correctly-spelled branch isn't pruned and its
continuation is the one that survives — conservative enough to avoid false positives
(closed-word-only, lowercase letters-only, prose mode, context-term exempt; ADR-015). It scores
each branch via `LocalModelRuntime.anchoredLogits(anchor: basePrompt, suffix: branchTokens)` and
honours cooperative `Task` cancellation so a newer keystroke aborts in-flight work. `TokenSampler`
pre-selects the top candidates by raw logit before ranking so per-step work is bounded instead of
vocabulary-wide, and the per-completion cost scales with the number of branch expansions, so
`branchWidth` defaults to 2 with healed capitalized stems widened to 3 (ADR-084).
**Measure in a release build**: debug inflates per-token Swift work by 1–2 orders of magnitude.
**KV branch reuse (ADR-018)** decodes the base prompt once
per completion and snapshot/restores it per branch (and appends only the typed delta across
keystrokes), cutting the medium-append case from ~1140 decoded tokens / ~246 ms to ~115 tokens /
~87 ms (full prefills 12 → 1).

### `TokenProfiles` — vocabulary intelligence ✅
`AutocompleteProfile` protocol + `InMemoryAutocompleteProfile` (tests) + `TokenProfileFlags` +
`TokenStopBehavior`, plus the on-disk **ACPF** format: a memory-mapped `MmapAutocompleteProfile`
reader and an offline builder, with profiles generated in-app per model family (ADR-009/034). See
`03-token-profiles.md`.

### `CompletionUI` — overlays ✅
`OverlayMode`, `OverlayPlacement`/`OverlayPlacementResolver`, and the real borderless overlay window
at the caret rect — `InlineGhostTextPresenter` + `GhostTextOverlayWindow`, ported from `Red Dot`'s
non-activating, click-through panel (ADR-016). Mid-line completions render as a capsule below the
caret (ADR-048); text-mirror/multiline fallbacks cover web fields (ADR-029).

### `TextInsertion` — acceptance ✅
`InsertionStrategy`, `InsertionPlan`, `InsertionPlanner` (chooses strategy from policy), and
`PasteboardCompletionInserter`, which synthesizes paste via `CGEvent` (⌘V / paste-and-match-style),
non-breaking-space, chunked/char injection, and backspace-after-paste, with pasteboard save/restore.
Synthesized events are tagged so our own key taps ignore them (ADR-039); Tab accepts word-by-word,
Shift+Tab the full string (ADR-016/038/050).

### `AppCompatibility` — per-app policy ✅
`TargetOverride`, `CompletionPolicy`, `AppCompatibilityStore` with an **originally-authored** seed
table (terminals, password managers, code editors, web doc/chat surfaces) covering completion
gating, mid-line rules, Tab handling, insertion workarounds, overlay tuning, environment-context
gating, and custom instructions (ADR-022/027–033). To add a target, see `08-app-compatibility.md`.

## `Red Dot` caret-tracking code (ported — historical reference)

The hardest part of context capture — **robustly locating the on-screen caret rectangle** across
native, Chromium/Electron, and web (Google Docs-style) text fields — was solved in a sibling Xcode
project, **`Red Dot`** (`../Red Dot`), and **ported** into KeyType rather than reinvented (ADR-004/
006). This section documents what came from where; you normally won't re-port, but it's the
reference if you need to understand or revisit the caret/overlay lineage.

Files ported into `MacContextCapture` (caret resolution) and `CompletionUI` (overlay window):

| Red Dot file | What it does | Ported into |
|---|---|---|
| `AXCaretGeometryResolver.swift` | Resolves caret `CGRect` via `AXBoundsForRange`, text-marker ranges, previous-character bounds, deep Chromium tree walk, static-text-run estimation; multi-display CG↔AppKit coordinate conversion with quality ranking (exact/derived/estimated). | `MacContextCapture` |
| `AccessibilityCaretTracker.swift` | `@MainActor` tracker: AX permission handling, 30 fps polling of the system-wide focused element, normalization, status messaging. | `MacContextCapture` (convert polling → AX-notification-driven where possible; keep poll as fallback) |
| `RedDotOverlayWindow.swift` | Borderless `NSPanel`: `.nonactivatingPanel`, `canJoinAllSpaces`, `ignoresMouseEvents`, `.screenSaver` level, clear background — i.e. a correct click-through overlay above the caret. | `CompletionUI` (swap the red `Circle` for ghost-text/inline view) |

Porting notes (how the port was done — keep these invariants if you touch the area):
- Red Dot's 30 fps `Timer` poll was replaced with AX-notification-driven refresh + a low-frequency
  safety poll; per-keystroke latency matters.
- The **quality ranking** (exact → derived → estimated) was kept — it's what makes placement feel
  native across apps.
- The geometry resolver is `@MainActor` and AppKit-bound; it lives in a macOS-only target.
- The resolved rect feeds `TextFieldGeometry.cursorRect` so `OverlayPlacementResolver` and the
  overlay window consume it unchanged.

## Concurrency & threading

- AX calls and overlay windows are main-thread/AppKit-bound (`@MainActor`).
- Model decode is CPU/GPU-heavy → run off the main actor; marshal results back for UI.
- The `LocalModelRuntime` protocol is `async`; keep generation cancellable (a newer keystroke
  must cancel an in-flight completion).

## Debugging & observability

- **Prediction log (check this first when triaging completion quality).** The running app writes a
  human-readable, append-only log of every generation result and its acceptance status to
  `~/Library/Application Support/KeyType/Logs/predictions.log`. It is **truncated on each launch**
  (fresh ISO-timestamped header) and appended during the session; written off-main by
  `PredictionLog` (`KeyType/PredictionLog.swift`), owned by `CompletionController`. Lines are
  timestamped `HH:mm:ss.SSS`:
  - `PREDICT ctx="…tail" ["a" | "b" | …] → SHOWN "a"` — best candidate shown as ghost text.
  - `PREDICT ctx="…" [...] → SUPPRESS(<reason>)` — the `SuppressionReason` case the filter returned.
  - `PREDICT ctx="…" → SUPPRESS(noCandidate)` — generation returned nothing.
  - `ACCEPT(word) "<head>" of "<full>"` (Tab) / `ACCEPT(full) "<text>"` (Shift+Tab).

  Only a short trailing slice of the typed context is recorded (the candidates are the model's own
  output); the full path is also printed once to the unified log under category `prediction-log`.
  Future agents: read this log to see what the model actually predicted, why a candidate was
  suppressed, and whether the user accepted it — it is the fastest way to debug end-to-end behaviour.
- Context capture is summarised to the unified log under category `context-capture` (deduped to one
  line per change). The caret **debug overlay** (`CaretDebugOverlayWindow`) is off by default;
  toggle it from the menu bar to visualise the resolved caret rect.

## Module dependency rules

- `AutocompleteCore` depends on nothing app-specific (Foundation/CoreGraphics only).
- Everything depends on `AutocompleteCore`. `ConstrainedGeneration` also depends on `ModelRuntime`,
  `TokenProfiles`, `AppCompatibility`. UI/insertion depend on `AppCompatibility`.
- The **app target** (`KeyType/`) is the only place that wires concrete implementations together
  (`KeyTypeModuleGraph.swift`). Keep packages decoupled and individually testable.
